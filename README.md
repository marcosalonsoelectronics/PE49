Files associated to video Power Electronics #49: Impedance-based Analysis of EMI Filter and DC-DC Converter Interaction

Available at: https://youtu.be/oRphYd8tjzY

This video is a continuation of previous videos PE#47 and PE#48. In this video we study the effect of the EMI filter on the dynamic response of a DC-DC converter from the point of view of the impedance interaction. The three situations studied in previous videos are analyzed from this perspective: i) the unstable LC filter and DC-DC converter interaction, ii) the stabilization based on redesigning the converter compensator, and iii) the stabilization by damping the EMI filter. Finally, a particular design is shown to demonstrate how the damped EMI filter can oscillate if the damping is not carefully designed.
